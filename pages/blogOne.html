    <h2>David Yurman, Gamechanger</h2>
    
       <div class="imageContainer">
    
    <p>In 1972, David Yurman changed the game in the jewelry industry by being the first jeweler to set diamonds in sterling silver, bringing luxury and low end jewelry to a middle ground.</p>

    <p>David Yurman was born on October 12, 1942
    in Manhattan. In the 1970s David designed the sculpted bronze Dante necklace as a gift for his wife. A gallerist fell in love with it and placed a few in her gallery. They immediately sold out, launching the Yurmanâ€™s first jewelry business.</p>

    <p>In 1980, David Yurman, the brand and company, was created and he subsequently won awards in the coming years.</p>

    <p>In 1983 David Yurman introduces the first Cable bracelet. The Cable motif soon becomes the connecting element in every DY collection.</p>

    <p>In 1999, the first David Yurman flagship store opened on Madison Avenue.</p>
        
    <p>Now a staple name in the jewelry industry, David Yurman brings inspiration to other up and coming jewelers. And with good reason.</p>
