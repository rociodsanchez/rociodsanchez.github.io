    <h2>About the Blogger</h2>

     
            <p>My name is Rocio Sanchez. I'm a 21 year old student and marketer from Queens, New York. I was born in NYC but I lived a lot of my life in Dominican Republic; my parents immigrated from there in the 80s.</p>
        
            <p>Now? I'm a sixth semester junior at the Fashion Institute of Technology. I study Advertising and Marketing Communications and minor in French. I anticipate graduating with my bachelor's degree in the winter of 2017. I'm entertaining the idea of getting my master's degree in Paris at L'&Eacute;cole Superieure de Publicit&eacute;, but I'll seriously consider that for a while. Money doesn't grow on trees, you know.</p>
    
    
    <p>This blog is about the jewelry industry. I worked with a small jewelry company through the summer and found the industry very fascinating. This blog is a way for me to explore that!</p>
        
            <p>But jewelry isn't really my niche. I'm actually really involved in the LGBT community! I have a project called "The LGBT Masterlist Project". As a member of the community I felt a personal responsibility to use my professional skills as a marketer and bring valuable content to my followers on my personal Tumblr blog.</p>
    
            <p>At the end of the project, I made a video to accompany the project. The point of the video was to add substance to my content, a face behind a project. It really helped get more followers behind me too!</p>
